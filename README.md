# Deadlift-
This is a Python script that uses the Mediapipe library to detect human body landmarks and classify the user's posture into two stages: "down" and "up", which are used to count the number of repetitions of a deadlift exercise. 
The script uses a pre-trained machine learning model to classify the user's posture based on the body landmarks detected by the Mediapipe library. The script also creates a graphical user interface using the tkinter library to display the current stage, the number of repetitions and the probability of the current posture being correct. The user can reset the counter by clicking on a "RESET" button.
landmarks is a list that contains 132 elements, where each element represents a coordinate value. The coordinates are divided into groups of 4, with each group representing the coordinates of a specific point. The coordinates are labeled x1, y1, z1, and v1 for the first point, x2, y2, z2, and v2 for the second point, and so on, up to x33, y33, z33, and v33 for the 33rd point.
